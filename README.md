## Quick Start

This guide provides a quick way to get started with our project. Please see our [docs]() for a more comprehensive overview.

### Requirements

* A Mars or Earth sized terrestrial planet
* 1.35e18 metric tonnes of water
* 3210 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide

<!-- ☝️ Replace with a bullet-point list of your requirements, including hardware if applicable ☝️ -->

### Setup Instructions

1. Find a planet satisfying the above requirements
2. Clone terraformly Python package via `git clone git@github.com:riverma/terraformly.git`

<!-- ☝️ Replace with a bullet-point list of how to set up your software prior to running ☝️ -->

### Run Instructions

1. Navigate to the directory where terraformly is installed, i.e. `terraformly`
2. Run Python code, by first opening a terminal window
```
cd terraformly
python terraformly.py
```
5. Wait approximately 100 years
6. See example output in screenshot at the top of this README

### Usage Examples

#### Terraforming Mars

```
python terraformly.py --label Mars --planet-type terrestrial --surface-area 55.91 --surface-area-units million-sq-miles
```

Expected results:
```

(192 years later)
Done.
```

#### Terraforming Luna

```
python terraformly.py --label Luna --planet-type moon --surface-area 38 --surface-area-units million-sq-km
```

Expected results:
```
Sorry. Not enough water present for terraforming.
```
