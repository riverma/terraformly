<!-- ☝️ Replace with a numbered list of how to set up your software prior to running ☝️ -->

### Run Instructions

1. To simulate the terraforming process, run:
   ```shell
   python terraform.py --label "Mars" --planet-type terrestrial --surface-area 144.8 --surface-area-units million-sq-km
   ```
2. Watch the script output the terraforming process status.

<!-- ☝️ Replace with a numbered list of your run instructions, including expected results ☝️ -->

### Usage Examples

* Simulating terraforming for Earth-sized planet:
  ```shell
  python terraform.py --label "Earth" --planet-type terrestrial --surface-area 148.9 --surface-area-units million-sq-km
