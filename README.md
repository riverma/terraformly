<!-- ☝️ Screenshot of your software (if applicable) ☝️ -->

This software was created to terraform an entire planet. It takes only seconds to launch. It's intended to be used by heads of state only. 
<!-- ☝️ Replace with a more detailed description of your repository, including why it was made and whom its intended for.  ☝️ -->

## Features

* Terraform a terrestrial planet in seconds
* Generate logs of terraforming actions completed
* Future-proof terraforming for long-lasting results

<!-- ☝️ Replace with a bullet-point list of your features ☝️ -->

## Quick Start

### Requirements

* A Mars or Earth sized terrestrial planet
* 1.35e18 metric tonnes of water
* 3210 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide

<!-- ☝️ Replace with a bullet-point list of your requirements, including hardware if applicable ☝️ -->

### Setup Instructions

1. Find a planet satisfying the above requirements
2. Clone terraformly Python package via `git clone git@github.com:riverma/terraformly.git`
